title: About
---

My name is Andy Georges. I am a computer scientist, with interest in program
performance prediction and evaluation, functional programming, benchmarking and
high-performance computing.

Currently I work at the HPC UGent team, where we maintain 7 clusters, for a
total of almost 14,000 cores.

Other than that, I enjoy reading the better fantasy and SF, e.g., Steven
Erikson, Georges Martin, Glen Cook and Ian M. Banks.
