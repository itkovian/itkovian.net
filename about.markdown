title: About
---

My name is Andy Georges. I am a computer scientist, with interest in program
performance prediction and evaluation, functional programming, benchmarking and
high-performance computing. I got both my master's degree (back then still
`licentiate`) in Computer Science and my PhD. in Engineering Sciences: Computer
Science from Ghent University.

Currently I work at the [HPC UGent team](http://hpc.ugent.be), where we
maintain 7 clusters, for a total of almost 14,000 cores.

I am (and have been) a jury member of the [Flemish Programming
contest](http://vlaamseprogrammeerwedstrijd.be).

Favourites:
    * editor: Vim (duh)
    * programming language: Haskell
    * food: self-made lasagna
    * band: Pearl Jam

Other than that, I enjoy reading the better fantasy and SF, e.g., Steven
Erikson, Georges Martin, Glen Cook and Ian M. Banks.
