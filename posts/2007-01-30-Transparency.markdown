I followed a link on the
[DefectiveByDesign](http://www.defectivebydesign.org/en/node) to the
amazon.com Windows Vista [overview
page](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_sw/105-2833134-3756440?url=search-alias=software&field-keywords=vista&Go.x=12&Go.y=10&Go=Go).
I skimmed through to the Full Business Edition (yikes!), and noticed the
fabulous new stuff Vista has, such as ... transparency.
