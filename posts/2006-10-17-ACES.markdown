On October 3rd and 4th, I attended the
[ACES](http://www.elis.ugent.be/aces) symposium. It is an opportunity
for the PhD students of the participating
[research](http://www.hipeac.net/) groups to present their ongoing work
or wild ideas they would like to try out by means of a poster and a
small introductory presentation. Obviously, getting practice for giving
presentations is always a Good Thing (tm). Additionally, it is a chance
to socialize during the recurring bowling evening, and to exchange
ideas. All in all, a good time is ensured, though the food - while
excellent - can use larger amounts :-) Pictures can be found on
