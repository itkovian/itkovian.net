Like the previous years, our research group, which is part of the
[HiPEAC](http://hipeac.net/) network, organises the ACACES Summer
School. Due to the earthquake hitting L'Aquila a few months ago, we've
relocated to Terrassa, near Barcelona, Spain.

The facilities are sweet, the food is good (so far), and there is a neat
swimming pool. And free WiFi.


Case in point: my room. It had WiFi, and UTP jacks at the desk and the
toilet :-)

The building had a very neat design, using rusty metal and metal
moveable shutters.

The pool was really enjoyable, even at 1:00 AM, though people tended to
dive in with their clothes on at that point.

Next to the main conference hotel, there was an older building, where we
held our poster session. And where the wedding party we crashed on
Friday was held.

Over the next few days, I'm going to post the notes I have taken in the
courses I am attending. Nothing fancy, just what I jotted together.


If you are on twitter, you can also
[grab](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=#acaces09) the posts tagged
with 
asked us to use them during his invited talk on Monday evening.


As I have been appointed as the official photographer of the event,
pictures will be available in large quantities on
[flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/itkovian/sets/72157621355868826/).
There is also a flickr ACACES [group
pool](http://flickr.com/groups/acaces) where you can add notes, tag the
pictures and add your own.
