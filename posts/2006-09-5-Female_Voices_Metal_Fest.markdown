Yes! I managed to secure three tickets to the Metal Female Voices Fest
taking place on October 21st at Wieze, Belgium. The sole reason being
that Tristania is coming to play. I saw them perform once before as the
prelude to Lacrimosa, sometime back in 199x.


I hope the other bands playing aren't too shabby. And that their live
performace holds up. And that there are no technical issues to deal
with.
