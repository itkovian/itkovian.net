I have submitted my PhD dissertation --- titled 'Three pitfalls in Java
performance evaluation' --- to the [Faculty of
Engineering](http://www.firw.ugent.be/) who convened on February 20th,
2008 and decided I was to be allowed to the first (internal) defense. I
have sent my dissertation to my jury members, who are (alphabetically
ordered):


-   -   prof. [Yolande Berbers](http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~yolande/),
KULeuven
-   prof. [Kris Coolsaet](http://twizz.ugent.be/), UGent
-   prof. [Koen De Bosschere](http://www.elis.ugent.be/~kdb/)
(promotor), UGent
-   prof. [Lieven Eeckhout](http://www.elis.ugent.be/~leeckhou/)
(co-promotor), UGent
-   prof. [Matthias
Hauswirth](http://www.inf.unisi.ch/faculty/hauswirth/), University
of Lugano, Switzerland
-   prof. [Kathryn McKinley](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mckinley/),
University of Texas at Austin, USA
-   prof. [Jan Van
Campenhout](http://trappist.elis.ugent.be/~jvncampe/), UGent
-   prof. Ronny Verhoeven (chair), UGent,


Basically, the internal defense amounts to a two-hour session in which I
have to answer a barrage of questions from my jury. If I pass this test,
I will be allowed to the public and second defense. April 11 is D-day
for now.
