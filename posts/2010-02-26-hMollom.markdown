You may or may not be aware of the excellent anti-spam service provided
by [Mollom](http://mollom.com/), founded by two friends and colleagues,
[Dries Buytaert](http://buytaert.net/) and Benjamin Schrauwen. Mollom
provides an API to program against, allowing support libraries to be
written in a variety of languages and for numerous platforms. Top-notch
examples are the [Drupal](http://drupal.org/)
[plugin](http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/mollom-6.x-1.12.tar.gz)
(obviously :-) and the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)
[plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-mollom). Next to that
there are a number of libraries for Java, PHP5, Ruby, Python, etc.
Sadly, a [Haskell](http://haskell.org/) library was lacking.


Given that I enjoy programming in Haskell and need to sharpen my
Haskell-fu, I set out to write a library for interfacing with the Mollom
[API](http://mollom.com/api/mollom-basics). The library is far from
finished, but it is functional at this point, so if you have Mollom
keys, you can call the services and fight the spam war on your Haskell
driven website.


I maintain two repositories where you can get the library:


-   -   At [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/):
[hMollom](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hMollom)
-   -   -   At [github](http://github.com/):
[hMollom.git](http://github.com/itkovian/hMollom)
-   


At this point the library has been given version 0.1. So it is still
lacking quite a lot of features. Stuff that is on the immediate TODO
list:


-   -   Add fault handling
-   -   -   Add server list refreshing
-   -   -   Encapsulate the state in a monad
-   


Any feedback is appreciated.
