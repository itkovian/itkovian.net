Yay! There seems to be a new short story by Steven Erikson on its way to
the [PS Publishing](http://www.pspublishing.co.uk/) press. Following
*Blood Follows* and *The Healthy Dead*, the story takes up again with
your favourite necromancers, Bauchelain and Korbal Broach. Additionally,
all three stories can be ordered together in a box. This will be the
first time I won't be going for a signed version, as Steven Erikson will
apparently only sign the hardcover edition (500 copies). I hope to get
my hands on a paperback version (or semi-hardcover), of which 1000
copies will be printed.
