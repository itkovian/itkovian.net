Last Saturday, I had my first Wii experience. We started out playing Wii
sports. Tennis was uber-fun, boxing seemed not that much fun, but that
might have been because we only had a single remote with a nunchack, so
we had to play against the machine. We then moved on to the Raving
Rabbits, which was great fun, but very tiresome for some games. My arms
still ache a bit. The dancing and island running was cool, though one
must overcome any fear of making a fool out of himself at first.
Finally, we returned to Wii sports, played some more tennis and finished
the evening (or rather, the night) with a game of golf.


I like the tennis best, because it feel most like you really are playing
a human opponent, unlike golf, where you have to sit around and wait.
The worse your opponent, the longer the wait. So, if I would ever buy a
Wii, tennis will be played abundantly. I do think that, while the
interface is good to play with initially, if you play a lot, you might
yearn for some more control over your tennising avatar. I'm not sure if
that's possible, but using other input besides the timing of the swings
might be useful, e.g., using the nunchack.


Anyway, a great experience, and my girl seemed to like it too. So, I'm
having high hopes for the future :-)
