I am in Seattle for the VEE conference. I had better be bloody
interesting, because the flight over here was tedious. Please remind me
not to hop from Europe to Seattle in two jumps next time. If you map the
flight curve on the globe, the trip from Brussels to Chicago is about as
long as the trip from Heathrow to Seattle. And the food on the AA flight
... sucked. I had brought two apples and a banana along, but since you
cannot import apples into the USA, I had to hand them over at customs.
Luckily I ate the banana. On a positive note, they sell very good apples
here. I guess they're filled with hormones, because they are huge.
