It has been three weeks, I think, since I bought [Nine Inch
Nails](http://www.nin.com/) latest album, [Year
Zero](http://yearzero.nin.com/). I steadily grew to like it more and
more, and it has not been off my iPod playlist the last week. If not
Trent's best album to date, it certainly is a good match for The
Downward Spiral.


I hope that Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D is able to match it even halfway.
