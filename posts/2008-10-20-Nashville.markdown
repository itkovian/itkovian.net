I am in Nashville for the OOPSLA conference. As there was nothing I paid
for this morning, I went to check out the downtown area. It probably
suffices to say that I walked for less than 2.5 hours, and I think I
pretty much saw the entire area. The city blocks are mainly made up of
churches and parking lots. I found exactly two gift shops, where they
mainly sold Elvis Presley gadgets.


I found one reasonably decent shop where they sold breakfast, there are
a few restaurants that might - might - serve decent food, and one Coyote
Ugly saloon. I doubt one can have a quiet dinner there, but for a
[salad](http://www.blueshoecafe.com/coyoteugly.pdf) after the OOPSLA
reception it might do ;-)
