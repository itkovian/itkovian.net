Title:  Numbers thinks for you

As pleased as I am with the iWork'08 suite, the new kid on the block,
i.e., Numbers, does lack some things I like, or better, that I need.
Performance issues aside, Numbers is quite a nitfy tool, provided you
let it do the thinking for you. Especially with respect to charts.


Consider the following problem. Given a set of data, containing a few
outlying values, create a chart that zooms in on the majority of the
data, leaving the outliers off the plot. Cannot do. The Numbers Help has
this to say on the matter:


To format the value axis:


1.  2.  Select a chart.
3.  Click Inspector in the toolbar, click the Chart Inspector button,
and then click Axis.
4.  To set the value at the chart origin, type a number in the Minimum
field (under Value Axis Format). The Minimum value cannot be higher
than the minimum value of your entire data set. 
5.  To set the highest number displayed on the value axis, type a number
in the Maximum field. The Maximum value cannot be lower than the
maximum value of your entire data set. 
6.  To specify the number of axis markings between the minimum and
maximum values, specify a number in the Steps field.
7.  ...


Eh?! So you man that I cannot limit the Y-value range to the rang I find
interesting? You got to be shitting me!
