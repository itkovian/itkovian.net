The flight was very uneventful. Luckily. Unlike the last flight I took
with British Airways, Lufthansa managed to get us flying on schedule.
The food on board was quite good, actually. I took the chicken, which
seemed to have been killed prematurely, because apparently, there was
very little meat available. The only drawback was the lack of sufficient
drinks. Refusing one kind of juice results in the stewardess passing us
by on the second round, rather than offering us water.


From the air, Montreal looks spectacular. There are trees lined up on
each sidewalk, wich gives a superb effect as the leaves are coloured in
various shades of green, yellow and brown.
