Last week, I received my bank's card reader, which can be used to
generate keys for logging into the online system. The card reader
replaces the old scheme, which uses a key file, placed on your machine
and a password phrase, consisting of (at most) 32 characters. So, now
the security is based on the possession of the reader, the card, and the
knowledge of the card's 4-digit pin code. Previously, it was based on
the possession of the key file and the knowledge of a password phrase.


Of course, a lot of people will be careless and use a feeble password
phrase, or a short one, or one containing important dates, but some
people will also use a strong phrase. For example, my password phrase
consists of 30 characters, so that's 36
wonder if the security of the new scheme is far worse for my particular
situation. After all, I need to carry both the reader and the card with
me when I travel, if I want to access my bank account. Things do get
stolen, and breaking a 4-digit pin-code is not very hard. The claim the
bank makes, is that having a possession attribute that is not connected
to the machine, and thus not to the internet makes it inherently safer.
I wonder is that's really true. It sounds acceptable, until you compare
