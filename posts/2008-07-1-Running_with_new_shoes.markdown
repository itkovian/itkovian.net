Yesterday's run was longer than planned. I had not been running for over
a week, to make sure my leg would be recovered. I also bought new shoes
(Muzino Wave Inspire 4, I think (the box does not give any information))
at the [Running Center](http://www.runningcenter.be/) in Brugge. After
about 37 minutes, I felt like I could keep going for a while, so I took
a right turn instead of a left (after about 7.5 km) and ran towards the
dike. I had to keep convincing myself to not turn back home immediately
at each crossroads, but I managed to hang in there. In the end I ran
about 12.79 km (according to the [route
tracker](http://www.myasics.nl/nl/routes/route.php) on the myasics
website).


I took this route:

It might be a tad hard to figure it out, but I essentially ran along the
top line when leaving my home, along the waypoint marked '1' (In the
Vredestraat) to go down the map in the Steense Dijk. On the way back, I
turned left at the roundabout (about 200 m from the '1' waypoint).


The last kilometer was really hard, and I ran much slower than usual.
When I walked down (and up) the stairs this morning, my left knee was
not very cooperative. So, I'm taking it easy again for the next days.
The next run will also be shorter, to make sure I'm not getting injured.
