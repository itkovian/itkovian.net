On March 17th, 2010, [Ghent University](http://www.ugent.be/) organises
the second Flemish Programming Contest, in collaboration with the
universities of [Leuven](http://kuleuven.ac.be/),
[Hasselt](http://www.uhasselt.be/), [Brussels](http://www.vub.ac.be/),
and [Antwerp](http://www.ua.ac.be/).


For three different categories of participating teams (of at most three
participants), we offer five problems that need to be solved in three
hours. The goal is to have at least one fairly easy and one quite hard
problem for each category, but as we all know, a problem is only hard
when you do not see the solution. So YMMV. Still, we aim to have each
team solve at least one problem. For this, teams can use any one of
twelve programming languages: C, C++, C
Prolog, Python, Ruby, Scheme, and VB.NET.


Programming should be fun, but to add an extra incentive, we have up to
â‚¬2500 in prizes. So, without further ado, head over to the [contest
website](http://www.vlaamseprogrammeerwedstrijd.be/) and register.
