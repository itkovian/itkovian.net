Czech Republic. He kindly invited me to give a talk at his institution
on performance analysis. More to the point, I talked about the work we
had been doing in the past -- mostly my PhD related research -- on the
issues we found with prevalent experimental setups (see the <a

Next to that, I also gave a (short) talk on the metrics we devised for
quantifying (throughput) performance in a consolidated system. That talk
was pretty much the same I gave at HPCVirt earlier this year, so no new
slides for that, excepting a few changes. In the meantime, SPEC has
published SPECvirt, and they at least seem to be being this a bit better
than VMmark, but we still have to wait for more published results to
become available before unleashing our wrath on it, should they do
things in the wrong way :-)


During this trip, I met a bunch of cool, hospitable people who are busy
doing some pretty interesting research. I must confess that I had even
worse issues than normal remembering names. Czech clearly is not my
forte :-) After the exchange of ideas and thoughts, the trip definitely
seemed to have been worthwhile.


The flight to Prague was pretty uneventful, but the return flight was
delayed somewhat thanks to the small snow storm that decided to pick its
timing in the worst possible manner to pass by and say hello. Our
airplane first taxied to one runway, was de-iced there and then had to
taxi all the way back to the start of the other runway, as the one we
had previously been assigned to for takeoff had been snowed under too
much, I think. BTW, Czech Airlines. Free food and a free drink plus
coffee or tea. Eat that, Brussels Airlines. After the landing, we were
not allowed to taxi up to the gate immediately for undisclosed reasons,
but it made me have to run to catch a train. I skipped the purchase of
the obligatory Diabolo ticket and filled in the Rail Pass with
unauthorised writing gear (a ballpoint pen is obligatory, but I had only
a regular pen with me). Luckily -- unexpectedly too -- the train arrived
on time at Brussel-Noord and I could still purchase the Diabolo tax
ticket. Thanks to the new schedule -- which will prove to be bad in the
coming days, I’m sure -- I made it to the IC train to Ostend. The NMBS
even managed to deliver me on time at my final destination. A rare feat,
I agree.
