Apple issued a major battery recall, due to the fact that, apparently,
the same batteries that have wreaked havoc among Dell users, are also
used in the iBook G4 and the PowerBook G4 (12" and 15").


I recently bought a new battery, because the one that originally came
with my PowerBook was becoming unreliable, causing the machine to quit
without sleeping or shutting down properly. However, it seems this
battery is eligible for replacement, so within 6 weeks I'll be the proud
owner of two batteries. Which is excellent when I have to travel long
distances. I also checked the new battery, but its serial number falls
outside of the range given by Apple as the danger zone.
