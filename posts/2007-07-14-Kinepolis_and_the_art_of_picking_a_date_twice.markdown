Title:  Kinepolis and the art of picking a date twice

The [Kinepolis](http://kinepolis.be/) website officially sucks. And I'm
**not** just referring to the crappy interface. I admit, I was
inattentive. I mistakingly ordered tickets for the Friday Harry Potter
show at 17:30 instead of the Sunday one. How could this happen? I'm
quite careful when ordering stuff online, because once the button is
pushed, you're hanging.


The Kinepolis website specifically states that to buy tickets, one
should click the hour of the show one wishes to attend. So, check the
day (i.e., Sunday), uncheck the other days, to make sure I'm not picking
the wrong day, and click on '17:30'. Popping up is a nice new window
that once again gives you the hours of the various movies playing ...
the day you click, not the day of the show you clicked on! To the right,
it now appears (hindsight is 20/20), there are the days for which you
can select a show, starting with *today*. So, my mistake was to fail to
notice this and just click '17:30' once again. But what you should click
first is ... the day on which you wish to go to the movies. What idiot
thought up this scheme? And what idiot approved it? Come on!


Now, this movie better had be very, very good. I expect no less than the
same thrill the first Harry Potter movie gave me (I had not yet read the
books back then).


Besides that, the site is half fubar in Safari (2.0.4).
