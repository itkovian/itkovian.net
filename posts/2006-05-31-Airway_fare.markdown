Say you want to fly from Europe to the USA. Say that the departure
airfield is located near Brussels, and the target airfield is located in
the vicinity of Seattle, WA. Past experiences show that for a flight in
economy class, one pays about â‚¬800 for the round trip. Not so with
British Airlines.

Obviously something went awry somewhere. One would suppose that the
software checks prices against the average price for the given trip,
taking a lot of factors into account. When the given price lies, say two
standard deviations away from the mean, there must be something wrong.
Ah well. Maybe we'll give KLM a shot.
