Disclaimer: I am no designer. But when I take a look at the restyled
[VRT news site](http://deredactie.be/), I start to shudder. This is the
initial look:

So, a few things that particularly bother me. The banner with the
presenter's faces is far too large. I know what these people look like
and it add no value to the page whatsoever. The video selection row is
too intrusive, and should be placed on a sub-page, or at least somewhere
below. The first thing I like to do is choose a main topic, not watch
videos. And the bar is just ugly. The headlines are centered in the
page, but they take up too much space. It seems like they want a picture
for everything. The main topic selection box is located on the wrong
place: too low and on the right. In this country, we read from left to
right, top to bottom.


And then there is

As far as I know, you cannot disallow people to link to a page.
