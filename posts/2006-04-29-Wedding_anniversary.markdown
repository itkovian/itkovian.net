Today, I have been married for five years to Veerle. A lot happened in
the past five years. We bought a house to renovate, we moved out of the
appartment a few months later, bought a new car and had a son. Well, up
to the next five years as they say. As a side effect, today also yielded
a fine addition to my collection of books: the entire set of Calvin and
Hobbes cartoons in a hardcover edition. And our living room has been
equipped with a fine orchid I found for my girl!
