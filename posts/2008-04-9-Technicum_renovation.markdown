Title:  Technicum renovation

All south-facing windows in the
[building](http://flickr.com/photos/itkovian/88531260/) where I work,
have been equipped with sun screens. That is, against the outer wall,
technicians have installed electrical sun screens. The idea is that by
keeping the sun out during the summer (it can get really warm in here)
we would somehow be saving energy. Yet the only air-conditioning devices
are located in the server rooms. And they lie next to a cool hallway. I
wonder how long it will take before the screens are attached to power:
the wire is there, I can see it hanging from the window (through which
they drilled a hole), but nobody came by to (i) clean up the dirt, or
(ii) connect the screen to power. Sigh.


If the university wanted to do something about the poor state of the
building, we would have received new, double-glass windows, with
high-insulating gas between the glass layers. But oh no ... better we
have sun screens.


I sometimes fail to grasp the decisions people at the upper echelons
take. No, make that most of the time.
