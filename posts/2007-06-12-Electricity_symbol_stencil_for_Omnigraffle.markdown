I have made a stencil for
[Omnigraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/) that
allows one to create the layout for the electricity grid in one's house.
You can get it from a [darcs](http://darcs.org/)
[repository](http://itkovian.net/darcs/omnigraffle_electricity_stencil),
or just get a zipped version
[here](http://itkovian.net/base/files/omnigraffle_electricity_stencil.zip).


Here's a screenshot of what the stencil items look like:
