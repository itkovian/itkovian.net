I was asked by the people from <a
href=“[http://zeus.ugent.be”](http://zeus.ugent.be”)
give a talk on benchmarking, since students need to both test and
measure the code they write for several courses and apparently there
still is no course which teaches people how to conduct experiments.
Being the yes-saying fool that I am, I agreed and figured out what to
talk about. It turned out there are a lot of things I would like
students to become more familiar with. In the end I ended up dismissing
a number of more technical things, preferring to talk about as many
subjects as I could.


I have made the <a

(in Dutch) available in PDF format. Ignore the jokes if you do not grok
them.


Thanks Zeus, for the Grimbergen bottles. I will make them count.
