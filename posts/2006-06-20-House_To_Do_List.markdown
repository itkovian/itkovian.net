It seemed like a good idea to post a list of thing I've got to do. That
way, certain people who provide gear and stuff can see what they need to
order and bring along. So, in no particular order:


-   -   Toilet downstairs
-   -   -   Cover the walls with plaster
-   -   Put in a new door
-   -   Cover the plaster and toilet coverage with nice wall tiles
-   -   Paint the ceiling once more
-   -   Put in the light
-   -   Finish with a nice paper on the walls
-   


-   -   Garden
-   -   -   Prepare boxing for the concrete
-   -   Fetch iron raster
-   -   Order concrete
-   -   Order floor tiles
-   -   Order flowers and plant them
-   


-   -   Bathroom
-   -   -   Put fiber against the wall
-   -   Paint
-   -   New furniture
-   -   Place wall tiles around furniture
-   


-   -   Living room
-   -   -   Order gyproc and metal-stut for the ceiling
-   -   Locate laser equipment to determine ceiling position
-   -   Put up ceiling
-   -   Order lights
-   -   Paint ceiling
-   


-   -   Basement
-   -   -   Order floor tiles for the storage room
-   -   Place floor tiles on the floor in a nice checker pattern
-   


-   


Ok, that should keep me occupied during the summer. Anybody experienced
enough not the render the place fubar is invited to help. I'll provide
the food (BBQ preferably, weather permitting) when the job is done.
