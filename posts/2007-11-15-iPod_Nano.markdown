Clumsy me has left his iPod (ok, Veerle's iPod) in his pocket, when
throwing his pants into the washing machine. I left it to dry, but
probably not long enough. The reason might be that Veerle insisted she
had to have an iPod when she goes running. As I also prefer listening to
nice tunes on the train, instead of hearing people rant about their
latest misadventures (such as dropping hi-tech gear into the washing
machine), I decided it was high time to buy a new iPod. The iPod Touch
is a bit too costly, so I went for the revised Nano.


The screen looks immensely better, and I certainly plan to watch some
movies on the little device. Now all that remains is to have patience
until it is fully charged.
