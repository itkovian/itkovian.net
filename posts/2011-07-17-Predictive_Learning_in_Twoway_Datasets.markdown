We have a paper that is accepted in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
2011:


Predictive Learning in Two-way Datasets, by Beau Piccart, Hendrik
Blockheel, Andy Georges and Lieven Eechout.


The abstract of the paper reads as follows:


We introduce a new learning setting, called two-way predictive learning,
as a special case of relational learning. We demonstrate that this
learning setting has some properties that make an alternative learning
approach, which we refer to as transposed learning, possible. We show
experimentally that transposed learning can yield better results in
multi-target learning settings.


We have used this approach to improve on the results we obtained in out

2006</a
Program Similarity”. The full results of that research will be part of a
future paper.
