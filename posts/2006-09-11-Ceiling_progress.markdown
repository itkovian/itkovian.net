Title:  Ceiling progress

This weekend I've put up the insulation and the gyproc of the ceiling in
the living room. To facilitate the job, I leased a special
[elevator](http://www.flickr.com/photos/itkovian/240282769/in/photostream/),
which can lift one plate of 3 by 1.2 meters without much effort. It also
allows for near perfect placement so the plates can nearly touch each
other. My father-in-law lend me a
[hand](http://www.flickr.com/photos/itkovian/240283436/in/photostream/),
and we had most of the work done by 6 pm. As usual, the bits I did alone
took a bit longer, and we finally managed to wrap it up at 22:30 pm,
which included vacuum cleaning and putting most of the furniture back in
place.


We still have to decide which [lights](http://www.wever-ducre.be/) to
put up, but we at least agreed on the
[positions](http://www.flickr.com/photos/itkovian/240309657/) they
should be put up at. We chose three circuits in the lounge space, and a
single circuit in the food-fest room.
