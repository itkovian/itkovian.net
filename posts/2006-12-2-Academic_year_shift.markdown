Yesterday, a proposal was made by the
[KULeuven](http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/) to shift the start of the
academic year to September 1st, instead of October 1st. The rationale
was that the exams could then take place prior to the christmas holidays
(a two week holiday), and that students could then actually party
without fearing the upcoming exams.


It seems that the students the national television interviewed were also
proponents of this idea. This seems quite silly to me. First of all, a
lot of students party for three months and start studying during the
holidays. Second, the holidays effectively add two whole weeks of study,
which increases the odds of passing the exams. Third, I think there will
be no more time to have an extra week in which lessons can catch up in
case of absence, or classes that were skipped due to days off during the
semester. Now there are five to six weeks after the christmas holidays
in which the exams can be organised, usually one week to catch up, if
necessary, one week to study and then the exams spread over the rest of
the examination period. Add to this two weeks of holidays to study, and
then cram it all into four weeks, max. Indeed, there are twelve weeks of
classes, i.e. that would be from September 1st to November 30th.
Christmas holidays start the week in which December 24th falls (in time
for yuletide). This gives students at most 23 days to study and do the
exams.


Clearly, a silly proposal for silly students. Which increases the odds
of it passing.
