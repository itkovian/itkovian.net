Last night, [Dries](http://buytaert.net/),
[Webchick](http://www.webchick.net/) and I went out to grab some food.
Travelling with somebody (read: Dries), who knows people all over the
place (thank you, drupal), has its obvious advantages.


We ended up at a place where they serve semi-Belgian food. I chose a
croque-monsieur, which was adapted to North-American standars, as they
dropped the tomatoes and the salad inside the bread leaves, bu otherwise
it was excellent. Kind of weird, they served it with fries, and they
were superb! And they sell Duvel - which I did not have, but now I know
at least of one place here where good beer is to be had.


And, Angie ... thanks for dinner :-)
