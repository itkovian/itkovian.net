Ah well, I'm about to have green grass and I already have a pretty girl,
so the song must apply. Since Friday, June 16th, I've noticed small
patches of grass coming through the topsoil. Three days later, the
leaves have grown immensely, and more than a green shine is clearly
visible. I am wondering though, if the lawn will be covered uniformly,
because the rain of the previous week has put a few dents in my
carefully levelled land. One can now see leftovers of footsteps, the
handle of the rake going back and forth, etc. Most grass leaves are
visible on the higher ground, not in the valleys, so to speak. We will
see what happens in the next few days. We still have eleven days to go.
