I did it. Order a MacBook, that is. White, 2.0GHz Core Duo, Superdrive,
Glossy screen, 1 GiB RAM, 80GB Hard Drive, Localised Keyboard. The
Glossy Screen because I refuse to flood the Apple banc account even
extra for a Black MacBook with a Normal Screen. The Localised Keyboard,
because the machine is a present (albeit paid from the common savings
account) for my woman.


Let's hope she'll enjoy it. Now, the waiting period begins...
