Title:  Airport Express

I've traded my old amplifier for an Airport Express with
[Kenneth](http://trappist.elis.ugent.be/~kehoste/blog/). Yesterday he
also provided me with a power plug, because the Airport comes from the
USA, and thus came with the wrong power plug. And I cannot seem to
locate mine that came with my PowerBook, nor the one that came with
Veerle's MacBook. Sadly, I seem to misplace a lot of stuff lately ;-)


Yet, the device works like a charm. I do think I am broadcasting through
my Airport Base Star, instead of directly to the Express, as the former
seems to be running pretty hot. Still, finally I can let the neighbours
enjoy my iTunes library. I'd recommend it to everybody.
