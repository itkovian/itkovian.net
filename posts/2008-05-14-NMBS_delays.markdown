Title:  NMBS delays

Two MTI students made a website where people can register the delays
they incurred when traveling on the Belgian railroads. For now the
website resides on the [ELIS](http://www.elis.ugent.be/) servers, and
can be reached at http://trappist.elis.ugent.be/
that the commuters drive the content which should result in an accurate
image of the actual delays, rather than the statistics the
[NMBS](http://nmbs.be/) gives, as they tend to drop delays smaller than
five minutes and prefer to give a more optimistic picture in general. So
if you are a commuter, and you use the railroad in Belgium, register and
start logging your delays. Spread the word.
