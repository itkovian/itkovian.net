While I think [Michiel](http://trappist.elis.ugent.be/~mronsse/) did a
great job creating a flyer for a PhD public defense
announcement/invitation in Microsoft Word, I think the world can use a
Pages'08 template as well. So, based on Michiel's work, I present the
[flyer template](http://itkovian.net/base/files/phd_flyer.zip).


This is the first template I ever built in Pages, and I am much indebted
to these [nice
guidlines](http://www.macworld.com/article/52716/2006/09/octobercreate.html)
on macworld.com. Of course, the template probably needs some polishing,
so updated versions might become available in the near future.
