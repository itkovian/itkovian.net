Just a quick update. I have moved the repository for PyMollom over to
[GitHub](http://github.com/itkovian/PyMollom). If you are unfamiliar
with [git](http://git-scm.com/), you can check out the library using git
clone git://github.com/itkovian/PyMollom.git. At this point, the library
is still the same, but I do plan on integrating the new language
detection ASAP.
