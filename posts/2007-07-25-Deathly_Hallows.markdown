Today the postal services dropped of a sweet package from
[Amazon](http://amazon.co.uk/), containing one hardcover book bearing
the ominous title 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'.

I'm at page 101, and it's awesome.


**Update**: I've finished it. Right now I think it's the best book in
the series, but a definite decision will have to wait until I've reread
it. I was very pleased with the turns the story takes.
