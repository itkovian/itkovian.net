Elias has been hopping around for one week, without a single accident -
toilet-wise. At least, during the daytime. When he sleeps, we still put
on a diaper. I think it's strange how he learned to recognise the
signals that indicate he's got to make a dash for it. Even stranger is
how, all of a sudden, he seemed to know what is required of him.
