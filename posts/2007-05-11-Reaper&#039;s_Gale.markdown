Dispatched on Monday, May 7th. Arrived at my doorstep on Thursday, May
10th. One box from [Amazon](http://amazon.co.uk/). Contents: The next
installment in the [Malazan Books of the
Fallen](http://malazanempire.com/) series.


I disliked the
[cover](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/images/0593046323/sr=8-1/qid=1178871757/ref=dp_image_text_0/203-6694556-8339161?ie=UTF8&n=266239&s=books&qid=1178871757&sr=8-1)
when I first saw it, but I've come round, and in fact, right now, I sort
of like the image of Rhulad (I think) sitting on his throne. I still
dislike the font used for the author and title.


I am forcing myself not to start reading right away, because I've got a
ton of other stuff to do, and once I start, there will be no stopping.
But hey, it's mine :-)
