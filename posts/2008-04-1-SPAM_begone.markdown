As you probably know, the moment a website becomes available on the web,
it does not take long before spammers locate it, and try to pollute your
content. I have no need for viagra, penis enlargement, large amount of
money that can easily be transferred to my bank account, etc. and I have
no desire whatsoever to offer these people another forum to offer their
(illegal) merchandise. So, task one was to find adequate means for
protecting myself, and (the few) people who read my rants.


Luckily, in the past, I have shared an office with
[Dries](http://buytaert.net/) who has been thinking hard on the spam
problem and has been working on a solution since he completed his PhD.
The goal was to provide not simply spam protection, but also to help
people increase the quality of the content, by protecting against
profanities, anonymous user registration etc. To shorten a long story,
this website has been using [Mollom](http://mollom.com/) as its spam
protection mechanism since its inception. As you can see, Mollom has
been quite effective, I've only had five (iirc) false negatives (spam
that was classified as acceptable content), which is almost perfect.
