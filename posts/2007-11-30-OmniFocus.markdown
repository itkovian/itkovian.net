Finally! The beta version of OmniFocus is finally available for
download. An added bonus is that you can purchase a license key at a 50%
discount if you order before the final release date (which should be
January 8, 2008). Additionally, this discount can be added on top of the
educational license discount, i.e., resulting in a price of $24.99 .


I have been putting off each GTD approach until this app would be
released. I have only used it for fifteen minutes, but it seems awesome
already. I immediately entered two projects into the library: (i) finish
the bureau room, which needs more paint etc., and (ii) my PhD tasks,
which mainly involve doing experiments and writing text.


Now, I'm all set for starting to do thing productively, which somehow
interferes with the [procrastination
loop](http://flickr.com/photos/itkovian/2065118775/) I remade earlier
this week.
