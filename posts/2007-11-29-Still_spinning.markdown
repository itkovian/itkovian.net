Title:  Still spinning

For those in doubt, I am still taking spinning classes on a regular
basis. I only skipped two lessons, due to having nobody to babysit the
kids. I feel like I am edging closer to the first plateau, on which it
is supposedly easier to keep going for an hour.


Last Tuesday, I managed to increase the resistance each time we were
asked to. Of course, much depends on the bike. On some bikes I cannot
get the wheels turning at resistance setting 4, whereas on others - the
ones I prefer - I can keep going at level 6. Needless to say, the higher
the level at which I can keep riding, the more fine grained I can make
my workout session. Still, I was quite pleased, though it had been the
toughest session I took since I started.


In the beginning I had problems with riding as fast as I could without
resistance. Somehow, when my brain started to think about what my legs
were doing and what they are used to doing, I messed up the rhythm,
causing strain to my knees. But, I must admit I have improved a lot, and
I'm more or less able to really go as fast as I can without missing a
beat. Keeping my heels down helps a lot too.


But, alas, no additional weigh loss.
