My, my. What a rush! One word to the world: don't mess with the Malazan
Marines. Or with Karsa Orlong for that matter.


It was awesome to see some story arcs come together, in mostly
unexpected ways. Of course, some things one might have guessed, but I
certainly never expected all of this. And once more, it shows that this
is no simple black and white tale. At times, I felt torn because there
was no way I would pack a side in a fight: both parties were likable,
though they were not necessarily decent people. But I'm quite happy with
the result. No, I'm very happy. It was sad to see some characters die,
but alas, the world is not - and never was - perfect. If you are into
this kind of thing, I recommend reading while listening to Tool, NIN, or
something else that has the potential to bring forth strong emotions.


And don't pick up the book before having read the previous installments
of the series.
