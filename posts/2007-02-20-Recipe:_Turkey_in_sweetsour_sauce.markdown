You should prepare [this
dish](http://foodlikethat.com/recipe/itkovian/turkey-sweet-sour-sauce) a
day in advance, as the meat is best when it can absorb the flavours in
the sauce.


Preparation time: about 1.5 hours.


Ingredients (for 4 people):


-   -   1kg of turkey (alternatives: chicken of porc)
-   250g mushrooms
-   6 spoons filled with raisins
-   6 spoons filled with small onions
-   30g of mashed tomatoes
-   dark maïzena (binder)
-   1 cube of sugar
-   1 glass of port
-   100ml of cream.
-   Salt, pepper, paprika


How to do it:












not bake it thoroughly, as we'll boil it afterwards. Do remember that,
as with all poultry, you must make sure that all parts of the flesh are
heated well, at 100º celcius, to kill of all the bacteria (unless you
have a desire to kill somebody, that is).



There should still be enough fluid from the mushrooms in the pot,
otherwise add a glass of water.


















add a (chicken) boullion cube, if you like.


Make sure the meat is submerged, otherwise, add either water or port.
Stir the lot. Cook for at least 45 minutes, and then leave to cool. The
next day, before serving:



sure to get it to boil, so the sauce binder can do its job properly.


Serve for example with beans rolled in bacon, steamed pears with
berries, and croquettes. Don't hesitate to make a bit extra, as the rest
can be kept in the freezer quite easily.
