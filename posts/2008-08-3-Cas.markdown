Today I became uncle to Cas, weighing 4.340kg and mesuring 54.5 cm. He
certainly knows when to make an appearance, as his mother was due on
Juky 21st, so she had to go to the hospital tonight to induce labour.
But it did not come to that. We're going to check out the little fellow
tomorrow, to count fingers and toes.
