Yesterday, we decided to hop down to the beach. We figured Elias would
really enjoy playing in the sand, splattering around in the water, and
use his new toys. Little did we suspect that a British trio would have
been there. Nothing against the British, mind, but these specimens
obviously were on their way to the nude beach, not the regular beach, or
so we thought after having (incidentally) observed the positioning of
their swimming gear. I can understand somebody want to tan uniformly,
but the beach is not the place to get your butt tanned.


Next time I see somebody expose himself like
[this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/itkovian/180511122/), he better
chooses a day with warm water, because I plan on (accidentally) pouring
some over him.


Really. If you want your arse tanned, do it in private.
