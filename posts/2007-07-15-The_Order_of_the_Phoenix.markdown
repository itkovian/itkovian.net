I was pleasantly surprised. Though the movie does not show all goodies
from the book, it's certainly giving enough information to be able to
follow the story. Fast-paced, quite dark, and with good effects. A lot
of spells, and while their childish names still bother me, the effects
were pretty awesome. As has been the case in all the books, there is
another new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: Dolores Umbridge. And
I liked her - or should I say disliked her. Bottom line: I'd like to see
it again, and the book has bubbled up in my to-reread stack. To its top,
actually. Before the last book arrives, preferably.
