To put it briefly: it sucks. We have little or no connection in our
room, even when using a hotel provided WiFi connection device. We can
get access in the hotel lobby, but uploading anything larger than a few
KB does not work. Opening a secure shell to a machine outside the hotel,
e.g., at work, is not possible. Thus, SVN access is simply fubar, as is
pushing patches to a darcs repository. Uploading to flickr ... no way.
Not even through the HTTP interface.


And to think the hotel is hosting a few hundred geeks attending OOPSLA.
