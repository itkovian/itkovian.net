Title:  Getting work done.

There is an excellent
[post](http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/how-to-shut-up-and-get-to-work)
by Jason Fried on how to actually get some work done in an invasive
work-environment. I was pointed to it
[here](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/httpwww37signal.html).


It seems funny that, while email is asynchronous, most people tend to
answer their mails immediately upon receiving them. As Andy Smith
indicated ([point
3](http://term.ie/blog/my-rules-for-instant-messaging/indicated)), IM
can be used asynchronously too. But people seem to be even less inclined
to use it that way. The bells ans whistles in the email, IM, and IRC
applications are not very helpful. We should really try harder to use
these tools in a way that benefits our workflow.


So, if I don't answer your email/IM/IRC message as soon as you'd like,
I'm most likely not dead, but simply trying to get a continuous
workflow. Yes, ironically, I'm writing about this instead of continuing
the work I was doing.
