We are fully on track, with a foetus of 29 weeks, 5 days Â± 1 week, 4
days according to the medical software used by our gynaecologist. She
said that all was well, and carefully avoided showing anything by which
we might guess our baby's sex :-) We saw a fast beating heart, its
lungs, its legs ... it was simply awesome. Next check in four weeks.
