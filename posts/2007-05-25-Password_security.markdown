When one wants to use the services on the [Belgian Federal
Government](http://www.fgov.be/) web site, one needs to create an
account. therefore, one needs a login and (obviously) a pasword. Now,
the rules state that the pasword must only consist of letters and
numbers. So, no punctuation characters. How does one generate a strong
pasword? One needs to ensure that brute force attacks are not worth the
effort, by using a password that contains a lot of characters, and such
that each character comes from as large a set as possible. And such that
the password cannot be looked up in any dictionary, i.e., it is not an
existing word. So, excluding a large portion of the readable ASCII set
is not a good thing IMO.
