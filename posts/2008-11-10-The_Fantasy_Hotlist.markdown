I just received this awesome mail this morning:


"Hi there!


The announcement will be made today on the blog, but I just wanted to
let you know that you are one of the winners of the Peter V. Brett
contest! As such, you will receive a signed copy of THE PAINTED MAN
delivered right to your mailbox! Expect the book in the next couple of
weeks.


The only thing I ask in return is for you to leave a comment to the post
announcing you as winner. That way, everyone can see that "real" people
actually win these contests!


Congrats!
