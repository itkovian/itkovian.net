No, I did not quit (yet).


I got tortured twice more this week. On Monday, I took an easy session.
I managed to do everything at a pretty high resistance setting. The last
race was too much though. My brain seems to want to think too much, and
there's no other way but increasing the resistance to slow down fast.
So, once I started thinking, my feet stopped rotating at the high speed
they had attained and I was on for a momentarily bumpy ride, until I
raised gears. The key problem is that you cannot hold your feet still
while the wheel keeps spinning, as you can on a normal bike. But heck, I
was glad I managed to put in the required effort.


The session on Tuesday was far harder. I could not get my wheels to spin
round with gears set to 4 (there are 8 settings, 1 is easiest), unless I
pushed really hard. So there was no way to make speed beyond gear 3.
Afterward, I asked the tutor to take a peek, and he told me somebody had
messed with it. Sucks, but by then it was too late. I was also told to
keep my heels down (I had no idea biking resembled horseback riding),
especially when going fast, otherwise the leg muscles tend to tensen up
and start to hurt.


This morning when I rode Elias to school, I really felt like I had
excercised, which, I think is a good thing. Seemingly, spinning helps to
build up condition quickly, so if I can make it past the initial few
months of training ... I'll be fine. The good news is that my scale is
showing about 1.2 kg less (on average) than before I started. Less candy
helps too :-)
