Title:  Spinning

Today was I took my first [spinning](http://www.spinning.com/) session.
The fitness club offers two options, easy-spinning and normal spinning.
Because I have not been doing any serious sports activity the last, say
6 years, we started out with an easy session.


Well, I'm still alive, and I enjoyed it much more than I had expected. I
was sweating like a pig though. But that seems to be part of the fun.
I'm not very used to the gears system yet, as I needed to crank up the
resistance a bit more, according to the tutor, as I started going too
fast when I stood up. Nonetheless, I rode most of the session at the
third highest gear, which I think is a pretty awesome performance,
considering where I'm coming from.


Next session: Monday 15th.


Goal: losing at least 5kg (preferably most of that in the abdominal
region :-).
