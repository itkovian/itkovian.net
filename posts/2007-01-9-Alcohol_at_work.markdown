Title:  Alcohol at work

I received a flyer today in which the university encourages its
employees to think about alcohol usage at work. I know of no people in
my immediate vicinity who have alcohol problems, but higher echelons
seem to take this matter very serious, as they should. However, upon
reading the flyer, I noticed a page on which the reasonable amount of
alcohol a healthy person may drink, is discussed. Three rules are
presented:


-   -   On average, drink no more than three glasses a day (two for
women).
-   At most, drink five glasses a time (three for women).
-   Don't drink any alcohol at least two days per week.


So, basically, don't drink over the weekend, as you probably will want
to remember the fun you had. And spread the 21 drinks you're allowed to
have accross the five other days. That's four drinks per day, except on
Friday, when you can start the weekend by having an extra drink.


It seems to me that the rules stated above are well beyond what's
reasonable. In my opinion, somebody who even drinks but one glass a day,
can get addicted, though it may not seem too bad. At first.
