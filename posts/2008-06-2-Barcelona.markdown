The hotel network seems to refuse passing through
[Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/) connections. HTTP, ssh, SMTP, etc. all
work, but Adium cannot make a connection to the jabber server or the msn
server.


Anyway, I'm in Barcelona for the [HiPEAC Computing Systems
Week](http://www.hipeac.net/computing_systems_week_barcelona). I'm
cutting it short, returning Thursday morning.
