Title:  Mobile madness

This is it. Is finally succumbed to the mobile phone infection. I guess
Poliel is not kind. It was, in the end, a pretty hard decision. I had
narrowed the choices down to either the Nokia 6230i, or the Sony
Ericsson K750i. I finally decided on the Ericsson, despite my dislike
for Sony since their recent DRM fuck-up. The reason I went with them is
my hapiness with my Sony Cybershot, and the fact that some relatives are
having issues with their Nokia batteries. The phone came with a 64MB
memory card - usable in my Cybershot as well, I assume, a headset,
USB-cable, and power adaptor.


The phone itself looks quite good, and feels usable too, despite my
right hand thumb being a bit damaged. As I am a complete mobile phone
noob - generally disliking the intrusion these things cause, I am doing
quite well handling the thing. I think. I am now in the process of
letting my PowerBook meet the little bugger.


Having said that, I intend to only use it for emergencies - phone-wise,
for making pics when I don't have a real camera with me, and for being
contacted by family. Now, the difficult task of keeping my number from
friends awaits me.
