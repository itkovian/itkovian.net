Title:  Parental leave

During the summer of 2011, I took three months of parental leave, to
which all Belgian employees are entitled. June was spent doing a lot of
chores for the renovation of my home, such as putting Tasso to the
walls, painting, plastering, putting up fake ceilings, etc. We also had
a new kitchen installed, courtesy of Studio RL. Though unplanned, I also
dedicated some days for work, finishing two papers. July and August were
dedicated to the kids. The weather was not as cooperative as I had
hoped, but we managed to spent quite some time on the Ostend beach.


September 1st is once more a dreaded date. Not that I do not like to go
back to work, but because I really enjoyed heaps of quality time with my
family. Still, traditions must be honoured, so Iâ€™ll start work with two
days of leave. Thus, I still have two weeks of vacation. Except that I
already seem to be doing some work in the evening :-)
