Since four weeks, I've been running on a regular basis, i.e., about
two-three times a week. I started out by doing 25-30 minutes runs, from
my house to the dike, along the beach and then back home. After four of
those, Veerle took me along for a longer run, with my father-in-law
riding along, giving us directions on where to run. After 30 minutes, I
thought I was finished, but then I found my pace, which was slightly
faster than Veerle's pace. In the end, I ran 55 minutes on a 8.8 km
route. It appears that once I manage to get past the 30-35 minutes
boundary, I'm all set to go :-)


The last weeks I've been keeping up the number of km I was running,
doing about 9.5 km in 50-55 minutes. Yet, I was still running with
simple Nike Air shoes, I once bought to play some tennis or kick some
ball when playing indoor football. Today I bought myself a new pair of
shoes (â‚¬125) that are fit to the way I am running. Needless to say, I
had to run a while on a track, while they recorded the way I placed my
feet. Turns out, I'm placing my feet pretty good, so I hope the shoes
help me avoid the pain I had last time -- which caused me not to run for
a week -- and speed me up somewhat.


Here's an example of the last route I ran.
