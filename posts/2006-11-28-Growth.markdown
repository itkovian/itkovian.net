I've seen the heart, containing four pumping spaces (two atria, two
ventricles). I've seen the spine, I've seen his/her hand - incidentally
while he/she was sucking on his/her thumb. I've felt him/her kick. The
head diameter has been measured at 5.5cm. The shinbone has been measured
at 3.3cm. The estimete length was 18.3cm and we're at 23+/- 2 weeks,
which places the size 1 week up from the 20 weeks we should be at. And
no, I do not know its sex. So don't ask or try to catch me saying
something that could give it away. I really, honestly do not know, and
frankly, I don't care. You'll know a few hours after I do. All I can say
is that the foetus looked amazing.


I'm thrilled, I really can't wait to hold that tiny creature in my arms.
