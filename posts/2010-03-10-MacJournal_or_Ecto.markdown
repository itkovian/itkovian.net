Title:  MacJournal or Ecto?

This year’s <a
href=“[http://www.macheist.com/](http://www.macheist.com/)”
contains <a
href=“[http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85](http://www.marinersoftware.com/sitepage.php?page=85)”
a journaling app that apparently also lets you post to (at least) a <a
href=“[http://wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org)”
blog. Up to now, I had been trying <a
href=“[http://illuminex.com/ecto/](http://illuminex.com/ecto/)“
which at first sights seems to be a bit more powerful, but perhaps too
powerful for my simple needs. Still, MacHeist is priced at $19.95,
whereas Ecto costs $19.95 in itself. I’m not sure if I will ever use the
other Heist apps, so it’s a tough call at this point. On the other hand,
MacJournal can be used for other things besides blogging. Such as
keeping track of stuff you did at work, for which I now use dead-tree
type recording. Aargh! The choices!


After trying to post it does seem that adding keywords is not possible,
so that’s definitely a minus for MacJournal.
