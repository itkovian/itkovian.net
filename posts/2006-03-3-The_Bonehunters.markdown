What a nice surpise I received today. Just as I arrived at my place from
work, the neighbour called out, indicating she had a postal package for
me. Not entirely unexpected, I admit, but still very nice.
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/) has succeeded in timely delivering
the latest [Steven Erikson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Erikson)
novel, titled *The Bonehunters*, book six of the Malazan Books of the
Fallen series.


I just glanced over the dramatis personae and to my great delight it has
some of the most fun and cool characters in it, e.g. the awesome Iskaral
Pust, Quick Ben, Fiddler, Karsa Orlong, etc. It seems like the major
plotline (I think) regarding the Crippled God will continue in earnest.
I can't wait to start reading. A Feast for Crows will have to be put on
hold, I'm afraid :-)
