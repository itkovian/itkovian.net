Title:  Reserve battery

Come to think of it, how likely is it that I'll be allowed to take a
spare battery on board of an airplane? After all, I cannot immediately
prove that the battery is genuine. It might be a bomb in diguise, no? I
would have to turn my laptop on and off, with both batteries before
officials might believe the truth: I am simply carrying a real spare
battery. Still, there is no way I'm leaving my â‚¬129 battery behind.
