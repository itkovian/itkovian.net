The NMBS (Belgian railways) keeps track of the delays each vehicle has.
They use it to produce annual reports on the preciseness of their
service. The aim is to keep delays to a minimum. However, I was told
that, as long as the announced delay does not equal or exceed 10
minutes, they delay is dropped from the statistics.


I've been commuting between Ghent and Ostend for the past ten years, and
it is quite rare that they use delays that are not a multiple of five
minutes. So, perhaps this was a neat way to improve, shall we say, the
annual report :-)
