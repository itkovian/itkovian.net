Being a post-doctoral researcher is pretty awesome. You get to decide (mostly)
which project and research you will be working on, you have your own (small)
pile of cash for purchasing tools, for traveling and visiting conferences, etc.
In fact, if the position would be perpetual (until retirement or death), that
would be totally awesome. Sadly, this is not quite possible. Post-doctoral
positions are usualy grant based, with each grant lasting about three years. You
can get extensions -- for example, the [FWO](http://www.fwo.be) allows up to two
extension periods, so you can stay procrastinating at the university for up to 9
years. In short, I was not going to get an extension. Too few published papers
and all that.

My contract with the FWO would stop on September 30th, 2012, at the lastest. So,
job hunting would be the first task I undertook after my 3-month parental leave.
And so I did. Twice rather unsuccessful, stranding on the second place. For
which there are no prises.

Fast-forward four months. Word had reached me that the [UGent HPC
team](http://hpc.ugent.be) would be looking for extra manpower. A former
colleague -- [Kenneth Hoste](http://boegel.kejo.be) -- had moved to that team
over a year earlier, so I had a pretty decent idea of what the job might entail.
I applied and was allowed to enter [Selection Round
1](http://www.assolutions.be). Apparently, things went
smooth. Previous experiences with Hudson selections for a job at the
[IWT](http://www.iwt.be) had prepared me pretty well.

A few weeks later I received a call from the UGent Personnel Department that I
would be allowed to proceed to the second round. Which would take place in three
days, i.e., the next Friday. This round consisted of an interview with the Unit
ICT director and employees.

Hurrah. And then anxiousness.

Three geeks were selected for this interview round. I thought I did pretty well,
except for the part where I was asked what I thought about Python. I highlighted
the pros (fast development (really?)) and the cons (no static checking of the
code (especially the types)). The other two guys went in after me.

Back to work at [ELIS](http://www.elis.ugent.be). Suit off, regular clothes on.
Wait. For. That. Call.

Which came two hours later. A friendly female voice at the other end told me
that I had landed the job if I was still interested in it.

W00t!

The other geeks, well, one of them already was working with the HPC team -- and
still is -- the other one got himself hired at the Unit ICT systems group. He is
now doing the setup of our storage systems with GPFS.

So, as of March 1, 2012, I started a new job with the UGent HPC team and it's
been a great ride so far.
