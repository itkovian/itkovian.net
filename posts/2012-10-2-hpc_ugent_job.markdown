Being a post-doctoral researcher is pretty awesome. You get to decide (mostly)
which project and research you will be working on, you have your own (small)
pile of cash to purchase tools, travel and visit conferences, etc. However, in
Belgium, the time you can be a post-doc is pretty limited. And unless your
publication rate takes off and soars high, well, an extra term is not for you.
Moreover, the number of academic positions that will land you that dream-job is
quite limited and the competition is more than fierce. As I had all of the above
against me, I decided to start looking for a new job. My contract with the
[FWO](http://www.fwo.be) would stop on September 30th, 2012. That gave me one
year to go hunting.

Fast-forward four months. Word had reached me that the [UGent HPC
team](http://hpc.ugent.be) would be looking for extra manpower. A former
colleague -- [Kenneth Hoste](http://boegel.kejo.be) -- had moved to that team
over a year before, so I had a pretty decent idea of what the job entailed.
Enter selections. Apparently, things went smooth and for that I really owe
Hudson some gratitude as they showed me the ropes when I applied for a job at
the [IWT](http://www.iwt.be). These did go well -- I frakked up in
the second round. But at least I was better prepared for the tests and the
interview following it this time around.

Fast-forward some more, and I received a call from the UGent personnel
department. Could I make time, like next Friday to come for an interview.

Hurrah. And then anxiousness.

Three geeks in a room. One of which I knew a little. I was the first to enter
the interview room. It had the impression it went OK-ish. I knew I was going to
have to program (mostly) in Python, but when asked what I thought about the
language, I did not fail to name a few of its shortcomings :-) It seemed that
was not held against me. Exit room and back to work. Suit off and wait. For.
That. Call.

Which came two hours later. That I had landed the job.

W00t!

As it turned out, the other two guys are now working at the same department as
well -- Jens already worked there and Kenneth (not Hoste:) apparently got a job
as well.

So, as of March 1, 2012, I started a new job with the UGent HPC team and it's
been a great ride so far.
