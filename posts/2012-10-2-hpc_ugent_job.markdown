Once the coveted PhD is obtained, the question of what to do after this hits
pretty hard. Going to industry or staying in academia is a dilemma that nags
many PhDs. I opted for the latter, not really knowing what I would want to do in
industry, and having a number of principles I did not readily want to give up.
For example, the desire to use the platform that I work best on, e.g., some unix
based OS. In my case, OSX. But one can only be a post-doc for so long. While it
is pretty awesome -- you get to be in charge of what you want to do and where
you want to take your research -- there comes a time when the
[grant](http://www.flo.be) ends and a renewal might now be coming along. So.
Again. Going to industry or staying in academia.

In September 2010, Kenneth Hoste defended his PhD. Prior to that, he had
conducted a lot of research using the -- then new --
[UGent HPC](http://ugent.be/hpc) infrastructure. After his PhD, he accepted a
job at the central IT department to work full time as a system administrator for
the HPC team. Apparently, there we two such job openings, but I did not know,
otherwise I would have applied too -- applying for a job a friend tells you
about, well, you cannot just apply for it as well, imho. But now a new
opportunity arose. The [Flemisch SuperComputer Centre](http://vscemntrum.be)
would procure a Tier-1 sized system, which would be built in the UGent data
centre. Hence a new job opening was posted and I applied.

My [FWO](http://www.fwo.be) contract would end on 30 September 2012, which meant
that finding new work was sort of becoming a concern. I had applied for jobs at
the [IWT](http://www.iwt.be) and the [KHBO](http://khbo.be). Both times I ended
second. And there are no points for those people.

Fast-forward a few months. I was contacted for a [Selection Round
1](http://www.assolutions.be). Apparently, things went
smooth. I had some experience from both previous job applications and this round
was similar to the round I participated in at Hudson.

A few weeks later I received a call from the UGent Personnel Department that I
would be allowed to proceed to the second round. They informed me this would
take place three days later and consist of an interview with the Unit ICT
director and several members of the unit who formed the selection committee.

Hurrah. And then anxiousness.

Three people passed the first round. So the odds rose to 33%. I thought the
interview went particularly well, especially when I was asked what my thoughts
were on Python. I highlighted its benefits, and then moved on to the typing,
which I really loathe. Ah well, no harm done.

Two hours later I received a phone call that I got the job and I could start
1 March, 2012.

w00t!

It turned out the two other candidates also worked at the Unit ICT. One of them
is a valued member of the HPC team, but with a temporary contract, the other
started working in the systems group, where he now tackles GPFS storage issues.

So, as of March 1, 2012, I started a new job with the UGent HPC team and it's
been a great ride so far.
