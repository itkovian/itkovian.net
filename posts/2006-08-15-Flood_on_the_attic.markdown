When we arrived home yesterday, it was pouring cats and dogs. I ran
inside, fearing the cellar might have been flooded, but everything was
ok there. I slowly made my way upstairs, to fetch a dry t-shirt. Passing
the bathroom, I noticed a puddle of water in the middle of the floor,
unconnected to any wall. Fear gripped me, as I remembered the water that
once poured through the ceiling into the office space, wrecking the
laminate on the floor. I figured the roof was leaking again.


Checking upstairs, I saw a large puddle, growing rapidly. I never raced
that fast down the stairs to fetch some buckets and some towels. I
yelled to Veerle and her dad to come up and help, getting a very fast
response. After we managed to stop the puddle from growing larger and
reaching the vent shaft of the bathroom ventilator, we looked for the
problem in between two periods of heavy rainfall. Clearly, the plumber
who put in the drainpipe from the roofs frontside to the back, made a
slight error. Not only was the output hole of the pipe partially
covered, the plate attached to said output hole was much too small to
withstand any backfiring water, causing the pressure to spout the water
back into the attic.


We managed to fix it by leveraging the stone covering the hole, and by
climbing onto the neighbouring roof once the thunderstorm had passed on.
Sadly, the water had made it through a crack in the floor to the
bathroom (hence the puddle I noticed), filling up the space on top of
our new shiny gyroc ceiling. Luckily, we used green gyproc, which is
supposed to be able to withstand a lot of humidity.


We'll see what the insurance guy says when he comes by. In any case, we
need this fixed soon. So far, we didn't notice any permamanent damage,
but this might change as the ceiling dries out. Luckily the new bathroom
furniture was not affected.
