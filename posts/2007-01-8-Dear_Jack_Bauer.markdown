IPv4-addresses are made up of four numbers ranging from 0 to 255. They
are nowhere close to 292.x.y.z. Really. After 5 series, somebody ought
to have mentioned this to those writing the 24 scripts. How hard can it
be to have a IT-knowledgable person review the stuff they are putting in
there?


I think that a good show gets the details correct. It somehow lessens
the tension when I have to get a good laugh at things like that. I'm
quite sure other things are wrong too, though perhaps it's easier to get
a weapons specialist helping out than finding somebody with a decent
degree in computerscience.


That said, I thought season 5 started out quite well. A small drawback
is that fact that people again seem to think Jack would kill Palmer.
Duh.
