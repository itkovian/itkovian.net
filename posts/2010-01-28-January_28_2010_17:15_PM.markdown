On March 17th, 2010, [Ghent University](http://www.ugent.be/) organises
the second Flemish Programming Contest, in collaboration with the
universities of [Leuven](http://kuleuven.ac.be/),
[Hasselt](http://www.uhasselt.be/), [Brussels](http://www.vub.ac.be/),
and [Antwerp](http://www.ua.ac.be/).


For three different categories of participating teams, we offer five
problems that need to be solved in three hours. The goal is to have at
least one fairly easy and one quite hard problem for each category, but
as we all know, a problem is only hard when you do not see the solution.
So YMMV. However, there should be something to everybody's liking. The
categories are the following: (i) secondary school students and first
year bachelor students, (ii) second and third year bachelors plus master
students, and (iii) PhD. students and graduated people.
