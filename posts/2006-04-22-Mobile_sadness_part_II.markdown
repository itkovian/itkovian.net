Title:  Mobile sadness part II

There are a few firmware updates available for my Sony Ericsson K750i,
but as I don't have a Winblows installation lying around, no update made
it onto the phone. Such is life in the Microsoft dominated world. Time
for the revolt, I'd say.


However, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel. Turning off
the phone and turning it on again seems to allow a new Bluetooth
connection to be made to it from my Powerbook. This allows me to get the
photo's off the phone and upload the lot to flickr. It also allows me to
sync my calendar and contacts to the phone. Sweetness.


I hope that when I succeed in finding a winblows crippled machine, and
upgrading my firmware without destroying the phone outright, the
Bluettoth heaven will be another step closer by.
