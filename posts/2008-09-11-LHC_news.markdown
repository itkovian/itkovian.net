Title:  LHC news

I am getting really sick of all the bullshit that is being said by
journalists about the LHC. For one, they are not deliberately trying to
create a black hole. The question why people are 'afraid' is just as
much crap. If the journalists would not make so much noise, nobody would
be afraid of anything.


I had expected a bit more from the [VRT](http://www.vrt.be/)
journalists, even though the program (Terzake) deteriorated since last
year. I also hate how they interrupt the interviewed person.
