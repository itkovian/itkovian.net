Title:  Panic!

Today is the first time OSX bailed on me. The circumstances were the
following. I usually let my new battery drain completely before plugging
in the power cable. This morning, I hooked up my iPod nano, and had the
machine run on battery. After a few hours, the system gave me a warning
to plug the machine in or it would go to sleep. I decided to let it
proceed. After the battery was sufficiently drained, OSX automagically
went to bed. Upon plugging in, and waking up, OSX told me that a device
had been removed prematurely. Obviously I had forgotten to unmount the
iPod. iTunes started up, and mounted my iPod just fine. I turned to
Colloquy to state that I was back, when the screen got covered in a
gentle grey tone, and a square apeared, neatly centered on it, saying
that I must restart my machine.


Upon restart, OSX told me it had crashed, and lo! a kernel panic had
occured.

The PC being 0x0 in that last state is midly discomforting, though I do
not know for certain if it is relevant to this crash or if the
information shown is somehow wrong.
