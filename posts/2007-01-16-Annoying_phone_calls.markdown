Since a few weeks, we've been receiving calls from +32 xxx xxx xxx. They
do not answer, nor is it a fax machine. The number seems to indicate it
is a mobile phone dialing me. Listening closely does not give any
indication of background noise either.


**Update**: It turns out that the aunt of Veerle's mom recently acquired
a cellphone, but does not know how to use it. Kinda hard to teach a 80+
year old how to operate a cell phone, even though it's basically dial
and hang up :-)


Lesson: tell your relatives to let you know when aged people are going
to play with new toys.
