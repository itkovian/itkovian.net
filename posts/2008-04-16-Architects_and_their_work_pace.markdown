In December 2007, we had a long talk with the guy who was to become our
architect for the reconstruction and renovation of our attic. He had a
number of good ideas, and seemed confident that we could do things
within the limitations of our budget. We were told that we should not
expected to hear back from him before February, which seemed fair. I
understand that he's a busy man, and such. However, we never heard
anything, and had to call him twice ourselves. Today, he confirmed that
he had too much work, and he would try to get something prepared by next
week.


I'm sorry, but a simple phone call, staying that the queue is full,
could we please have some patience, would have been much nicer. We might
as well have expected him to have a complete drawing ready. Which is not
the case.


So Mr. Architect, from now on, I have some time, and I will carefully
follow up your work. We shall not pay you a single penny too much, rest
assured.
