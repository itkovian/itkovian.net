The garden fence is up. Now we await payment from the neighbours, who
promised to pay half of the costs we made to make sure we can no longer
see each other.

If anybody needs some rocks, stones, or junk to burn, drop me a line.
There's plenty of it still awaiting removal.


Next step is the final levelling of the land. Tomorrow 9.5 tons of
garden earth (6 cubic metres)will be dropped on our porch.
