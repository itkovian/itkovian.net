I guess we will not be programming in Vista using speech control anytime
soon :-)


Of course, nobody in his right mind would even try it, but I think this
makes for a hilarious video nonetheless. I cannot say if the speech
recognition works for the stuff it's actually meant for, as I have no
(and never will) a Microsoft Vista Operating (ahem) System.
