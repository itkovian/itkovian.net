Title:  Water overload

The [building](http://www.flickr.com/photos/itkovian/88531260/) my
office is located in, has some flaws, it seems. It has been raining for
the last hours, and the water on the roof outside my window is rising.
Said roof shows no sign of any drainpipe being attached to it, but there
is one pipe coming down from the top of the building. I expect the water
to hit the top of the roof you can see in about two hours. I also think
that our window is just a bit lower than the roof. Ah well, the office
needs cleaning anyway.

**Update:** A plumbing person has arrived and has located the blocked
drain pipe. Guess that means we're safe. And that the office floor will
not be cleaned for another month.
