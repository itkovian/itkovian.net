After trying a few times, it still seems as if my Powerbook will not
connect to my phone after the initial setup connection. Each time I pair
the two devices, I am able to connect via e.g. BluetoothFileExchange.
iSync works then in 50% of the cases. After the first disconnect, my
Powerbook claims it cannot validate the phone anymore and refuses to
connect to it. Needless to say that this is annoying me immensely.


I googled a bit, but everything I found claims that the K750i and the
Powerbook should interoperate seamlessly. Not so in my experience.
Nevertheless, I'm keeping the phone, as it served me well earlier this
week when some person decided that it would be a good idea to meet a
train up front, and make contact with it. While it moved at 160km/h.
Picture quality is very satisfying too.
