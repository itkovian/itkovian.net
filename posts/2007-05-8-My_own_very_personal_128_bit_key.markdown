Title:  My own very personal 128 bit key.

I have just obtained all the rights to the following key 128-bit key:
"4A 69 BA 36 BF 5D 02 28 4C BA B0 DA 80 E8 2C 9C". I've been handed the
rights to this key for encrypting and decrypting the haiku you can find
[here](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=1155). So it's mine and mine
alone. I'll be scanning every single binary on every system I encounter
and if I even sniff a hint of my key, I'll be suing whoever authored
that binary.
