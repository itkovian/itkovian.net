A while back I noticed the announcement on [boing
boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/19/scalzis-old-mans-war.html)
about a book by John Scalzi being offered as a free downloadable PDF. I
had not come round to reading it, but as I had finished Thief of Time by
Terry Pratchett (thanks, Dries, it was awesome), I needed something else
to read. So I fired up preview and started reading [Old Man's
War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man's_War). It was very good,
well-paced and to the point.


Much to my delight I noticed the paperback version being sold in a shop
in the Seattle Tacoma airport. I immediately bought it, and I definitely
plan on buying the follow up books (Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony).
So, yes, the concept of offering something for free does work (I am a
sucker for paper books), and it gets you new readers. So ... start
making those cool books available online and people who might otherwise
skip them, will buy them.
