On April 30th, I am holding my public PhD defense.


**Title**


Three Pitfalls in Java Performance Evaluation.


**Abstract**


Executing a Java application is a complex matter when looking at what
happens under the hood. The virtual machine (VM) runs the operations and
takes care of class loading, compiling and optimising code, and garbage
collection. Due to the interaction going on between the VM and the
application and the non-determinism (e.g., due to time-based sampling)
within the VM, no two executions will ever behave exactly alike.
Performance analysis in this context should not be underestimated. In
this dissertation, we uncover three pitfalls that have not been taken
into consideration prior to this research.


First, we show that one should not extrapolate performance results from
one VM to another, and that small input sets do not necessarily yield
behaviour that is representative for large(r) input sets. Second, we
demonstrate that prevalent data analysis is falling short of the mark in
many cases and can results in erroneous conclusions when making
performance comparisons. We propose a rigorous statistical approach that
deals with the problems posed by non-determinism. We also add rigour to
one particular experimental design, namely, replay compilation.Finally,
we illustrate that Java applications exhibit phase behaviour at the
method level. We exploit this feature to allow a programmer to gain
insight in the performance of his application by allowing him to locate
bottlenecks and thus optimise his program by removing them.


**Venue**


As the examination is a public event, everybody can attend. I do ask
that you drop a note, or leave a comment if you will be attending.
Otherwise, you and several other people might find themselves without
drinks at the reception afterward. The event takes place in the Jozef
Plateauzaal of the Faculty of Engineering , J. Plateaustraat 22, 9000
Gent and it starts at 14:00.
