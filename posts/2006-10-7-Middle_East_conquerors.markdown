The Middle East is an area of much turmoil. Peace seems hard to attain.
Nations were created, people were driven out. Claims to land were made,
and old (religious) arguments were brought to bear. One seems to often
forget that these countries have been part of many
[empires](http://www.mapsofwar.com/ind/imperial-history.html) and that
claims to the land should not be made in haste, for political or other
reasons.


I do wish this nice animation has ended with the new US empire on the
map. It might open some eyes.
