Title:  Let loose

A judge has
[decided](http://www.vrtnieuws.net/nieuwsnet_master/versie2/nieuws/details/061006UitgelokteDiefstal/index.shtml)
(Dutch) that police cannot catch criminals when they provide the goodies
that will be stolen. I find this a very disturbing sentence. IANAL, but
I find this to be almost as close as the following.


In the above case, the police intentionally left a laptop visibly lying
in a car, in order to catch thieves. But, suppose you, an ordinary
citizen, leave a laptop in your car. You need to get some groceries or
bread, and you leave the machine sitting on the front seat. Can you be
held responsible if somebody steals the computer? Or, can the thief get
away with it?


Anyway, a thief is on the loose once more, despite efforts of the police
force to put a halt to breaking into cars in the Belgian capital.
