Title:  Ghent University has a new web application

So, Ghent University has a new portal site for employees where they can
get information regarding their paycheck, vacation, etc. So far, so
good. The downside is the way the *portal* is advertised. First of all,
UGent offers access to Windows applications via the Athena portal, where
selecting an app in the browser launches e.g., a Citrix client to
connect to the Windows server. Now, access to the new *portal* should go
through Athena, so naturally I expected to meet a Windows application.
And lo! I saw a Windows application starting. And it was ... the
Internet Exploder (IE6).


Give me a frakking break. (FYI, yeah, I admit being hooked on BG.)


Why would you want your users to go through the motions of logging in to
the application portal (Athena), and from there start a browser which
logs you in to a -- right -- web application?!!!?!?! The reason soon
becomes apparent. You cannot do anything with it, unless you use IE. At
least, neither Safari, nor Firefox or Camino seen to be able to show me
anything I can use.


I am flabbergasted. Really. We claim to teach people good IT practices?
I wonder where I can give feedback on this borked app.
